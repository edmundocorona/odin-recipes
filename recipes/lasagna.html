  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasagna Noodles: These are wide, flat pasta sheets that serve as the base for the dish.</li>
    <li>Meat Sauce: The meat sauce often consists of ground beef or a mixture of beef and pork, cooked with onions, garlic, tomato sauce, and Italian seasonings.</li>
    <li>Béchamel Sauce: Béchamel is a creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk. It adds richness and creaminess to the lasagna.</li>
    <li>Cheese: Melted cheese, typically mozzarella, is used to top the lasagna and create that irresistible cheesy crust.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Lasagna Noodles:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set them aside.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Make the Meat Sauce:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef (or beef and pork mixture) over medium-high heat. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until they become fragrant and the onions turn translucent.</li>
      <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and Italian seasonings. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Optionally, add a splash of red wine for depth of flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add the flour and stir to create a smooth roux.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens and becomes smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Layer the Lasagna:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>In a baking dish, start by spreading a small amount of meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Add a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce and a layer of mozzarella cheese. You can also sprinkle some Parmesan cheese and herbs between the layers for extra flavor.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers until your ingredients are used up, usually ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bake:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. This allows the lasagna to cook through and become bubbly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Finish:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Serve:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before cutting into it. This allows the layers to set.</li>
      <li>Serve your delicious homemade lasagna, and enjoy!</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
